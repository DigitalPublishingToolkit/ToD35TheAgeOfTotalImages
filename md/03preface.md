# Preface

> This appropriating mirror-play of the simple onefold of earth and
> sky, divinities and mortals, we call the world. The world presences by
> worlding. That means: the world's worlding cannot be explained by
> anything else nor can it be fathomed through anything else. This
> impossibility does not lie in the inability of our human thinking to
> explain and fathom in this way. Rather, the inexplicable and
> unfathomable character of the world's worlding lies in this, that
> causes and grounds remain unsuitable for the world's worlding. As soon
> as human cognition here calls for an explanation, it fails to
> transcend the world's nature, and fells short of it.
> - Martin Heidegger, 'The Thing'.[^pref_1]

I came to realize this book unexpectedly. In 2018, during the process of
analyzing the historical and technological development of post-digital
photography, I studied a variety of what seemed at first to be
disconnected areas of thought, including theories on the Anthropocene,
artificial intelligence, cartography and geography, the perception and
sociality of space, and beyond. Upon revisiting my notes, I realized
that hidden within were at least two manuscripts. So, I decided to
divide the single research project into two separate books: *Postdigial
Arcadia* and *The Age of Total Images*. However, each has as its focus
the consequences of post-digital photography for our understanding of
the world. This is a major theme in all of my scholarly works. Each book
is written in the domain of media epistemology and, therefore, in media
ontology as well. That is, I describe the space of existence separate
from a mediated space, and that theory will come back several times and
twist around various topics in this book too.

During the preparation of this manuscript, I had no access to funding or
research facilities because I am not a tenured scholar. Consequently, it
was a great challenge for me to do this research. I would like to thank
to Prof. Dr. Michael Punt, at *Leonardo Electronic Reviews*, for
assigning me books to review that so perfectly suit my areas of
interest, as well as for his help in gaining access to the literature
that I needed to write this book. I would also like to express my
gratitude to Prof. Dr. Oliver Grau and Wendy Coones, in the Department
of Image Science at Danube University Krems, for connecting me to many
great minds in the fields of image science and new media art, as well as
for coordinating my teaching in the international graduate programs
Media Art Histories and Media Arts Cultures so that I could also attend
conferences and exhibitions which relate to my focus. Also, I would like
to thank to dr. Oksana Sarkisova from Visual Studies Platform (VSP) and
OSA Archivum for organizing and supporting my visiting fellowship at
Central European University in Budapest. Their amazing offline and
online library helped me a lot in formulating my thesis. Many thanks
also go to Prof. Dr. Geert Lovink, a dear friend, and the editor of this
book series, as well as to artist Patrick Lichty, who always gives
constructive feedback and provides useful references. My former student
Devon Schiller has edited the manuscript and has done a splendid job
with his supreme language sense as well as his ability with questioning
and theory. And let us not forget Sepp Eckenhaussen, who produced the
work. Big thanks also goes to Clement Valla, an artist who permission to
reproduce his artwork.

Finally, I would like to thank to my mother Dragica, my Dalmatian Jere,
and Marin Krpetić, each of whom helped me to remain sane and stay
organized over the last few years as I was working on this book and
living among the noise produced by over-tourism of Diocletian’s palace
in Split, Croatia.
